Task & Tinker - A Comprehensive Web Application
Task & Tinker

Description
Task & Tinker is an innovative web application designed to amalgamate productivity enhancement with interactive learning. It combines a Podomoro Timer, task management system, engaging mini-games, and an intelligent scientific calculator to create a unique user experience.

Technologies Used
PHP Laravel: A high-performance PHP framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system utilized for reliable data storage and management.
IBM Granite AI: Employed for automating code generation and executing specific task-related functionalities, enhancing the app’s efficiency and adaptability.
Features
Podomoro Timer: Optimizes user productivity with customizable, AI-assisted intervals.
To-Do List: Enables dynamic task tracking and progress monitoring.
Mini-Games: Provides learning-oriented entertainment through adaptive Sudoku, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Quiz games.
Scientific Calculator: Evolves from a basic tool into an educational aid, presenting advanced mathematical concepts progressively based on user interaction.
Setup Instructions
Ensure you have PHP, PostgreSQL, and Composer installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and run composer install to install the necessary dependencies.
Copy .env.example to .env and configure your database connection and other settings.
Set up your database by executing the migration script: php artisan migrate.
Start the Laravel development server with: php artisan serve.
Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8000.
Note: For AI features to function, additional IBM Granite API integration steps would be required, as per IBM's API documentation and guidelines.

AI Support Explanation
IBM Granite AI aids Task & Tinker's development primarily by automating and refining specific functionalities. Its role encompasses:

Implementing tailored algorithmic logic for the Podomoro Timer.
Facilitating real-time data processing for the Task Management System.
Generating adaptive game mechanics for the Mini-Games.
Developing progressive mathematical concept presentation algorithms within the Scientific Calculator.
This application implementation underscores Granite AI as a powerful coding assistant, pivotal in delivering a dynamic, user-centric, and efficient web app.

Disclaimer: The project's GitHub repository does not include detailed steps for IBM Granite AI API integration due to the complexity and resource-specific nature of such procedures. Please refer to IBM’s official documentation and support channels for comprehensive AI integration guidance.
